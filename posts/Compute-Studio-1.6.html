    <p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Almost</em> automatic publishing and updates using GitHub Actions.</li>
      <li>Increased computational performance and efficiency with Kubernetes Jobs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Features Overview</h2>
    <p><a href="https://compute.studio/">Compute Studio</a> 1.6 represents a huge step towards accomplishing two goals that Matt Jensen and I set for Compute
      Studio at the beginning of the project. First, we want to make it easy to publish and update models on Compute
      Studio. Second, we want to efficiently use compute resources while at the same time making sure that users get
      their results as quickly as possible. This release reduces a significant amount of friction in the model
      publishing process and opens a clear path for completely automating model publishing. Further, this release
      drastically reduces C/S server costs while increasing the amount of compute available to the models. Throughout
      the development of this release, we worked to shore up other parts of the C/S infrastructure. These improvements
      include more secure secrets management, more isolated model environments, enhanced deployment tooling, and more.
      The end result vastly improves the current performance of the C/S compute cluster and makes way for future
      improvements. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release! </p>
    <p>Read on to learn more about what went into C/S 1.6. Or, if you just want to see the code without the long-winded
      release notes, you can find it in the <a
        href="https://github.com/compute-tooling/compute-studio/tree/master/workers"><code>workers</code></a> package
      and the <a href="https://github.com/compute-tooling/compute-studio-publish/">compute-studio-publish</a> repo.</p>

    <h2>Engineering Process</h2>
    <p>Before getting into the technical details of this release, I just want to say that this was a <em>really</em> fun
      release. The problems that we tackled are challenging, and they forced the C/S team to think through and try
      several different solutions before figuring out what worked. </p>

    <h3>Automatic Publishing with GitHub and GitHub Actions</h3>
    <p>The crucial insight for automating the publish and update process was that this is really a CI/CD problem. This
      insight made it clear that we shouldn't build our own tech from scratch, and that we should use GitHub (or another
      git service like GitLab) as the interface to our CI/CD service. There are several reasons for this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>GitHub already supports many types of CI/CD services which allows us to try one service and swap to another if
        we aren't happy with it.</li>
      <li>Many developers are familiar with GitHub, making it easy to discuss any build or test errors. Further, any
        PR's or issues that are created in relation to a particular build all link to the PR with the build failure.
      </li>
      <li>GitHub provides a REST API that C/S can use to automate the publish and update process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> because it didn't require me to set up
      other services outside of GitHub. It has predefined flows for doing things like building and publishing Docker
      images and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster. This made it easy to cobble together several existing configuration
      files to accomplish the flow that we needed. I also explored Microsoft's Azure Pipelines. Pipelines offers an
      easy, seamless integration with GitHub; however, it didn't add any additional features relevant to our flow that
      warranted adding another service to C/S's already complicated technology stack. As an aside, I was disappointed
      that none of the CI/CD services except for AWS's offering have a <em>hosted</em> service with configurable compute
      resources like number of CPUs and amount of RAM. I would happily pay for this feature if it was available.</p>
    <p>Next, I began setting up a git-based flow for publishing and updating models. I created the <a
        href="https://github.com/compute-tooling/compute-studio-publish"><code>compute-studio-publish</code></a>
      repository to serve as the home of the CI/CD service. This separates C/S development from the chatter of model
      updates. The <code>compute-studio-publish</code> repo has a configuration file for each public model on C/S
      located at <code>config/:owner/:title.yaml</code>. An update is triggered when a PR is opened with the model's
      modified file. Currently, I manually start the update process when I get an automated email notification after a model
      update on C/S or if a model maintainer asks for an update. In the future, this step will be triggered by a model maintainer from the C/S
      GUI or REST API. </p>
    <p>The update and deploy sequence looks like this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Update the timestamp in the configuration file, and open a PR with the modified file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The PR kicks off a build, test, and push sequence. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The build step creates a docker image with all of the model's dependencies. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The test step runs the compute-studio tests for this model.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the tests pass, then the docker image is pushed to the C/S docker image repository and the model's staging
          tag is updated. If the tests fail, then the build fails. Once the model maintainer fixes the errors, the PR is
          updated and the build and test process is started again.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The PR is merged by a C/S maintainer, and the webapp and compute cluster are updated with the latest version
          of the model.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Zero-to-N Scaling with Kubernetes Jobs</h3>
    <p>Making progress on C/S's goal of automatically publishing models came easily once I realized that this was
      actually a well-known and very solved problem. After that, the implementation was a matter of tying together
      various existing services and automating the build/test/deploy steps. Making progress on C/S's scalability problem
      did not come this easily--it was a year long grind. In the early days of C/S, the models were run on a single
      Digital Ocean server using docker-compose. Jobs were submitted to the cluster through a Flask API, and the jobs
      were run by Celery workers. Eventually, I moved the configuration from docker-compose to docker swarm and finally
      to Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The move to Kubernetes and GCP made it easier to set up autoscaling
      rules based on CPU usage for each model's celery workers. This improved C/S's scalability, but it made the compute
      costs way too high. The reason for the high costs was that each model had to have at least one celery worker
      running at all times, resulting in a lot of idle servers.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://hankdoupe.com/posts/Compute-Studio-0.16.0.html">first attempt</a> at fixing this problem was
      to use <a href="">Dask</a> and its <a href="https://kubernetes.dask.org/en/latest/">Kubernetes support</a> to
      scale compute. We added Dask cluster support as a beta-level feature, but soon discovered that submitting more
      than two or three simulations at once caused a scheduling traffic jam. Each simulation had several long-running
      tasks, and each of these tasks held onto one of a Dask worker's threads. Eventually, there wasn't anywhere to
      schedule sub-tasks and all of the simulations would stall until more workers could be added to the cluster. Next,
      Matt Jensen and I spent some time exploring projects that were more in the ETL space like <a
        href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a> and <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/">Prefect</a>. Apache
      Airflow seemed like a great solution, and in particular, its <a
        href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/executor/kubernetes.html">Kubernetes support</a> looked like it
      would offer exactly what we needed. However, Airflow seemed to be geared more towards data-science jobs that are
      scheduled to run on a regular basis and not jobs that need to be run on-demand. Prefect seemed like an evolution
      from our initial approach of using Dask to schedule jobs, but it felt a little too new for us to base our
      long-term infrastructure on. Finally, I decided to give <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/">Kuberenetes Jobs</a> a
      try. Throughout this process, I kept coming back to the Jobs documentation page and wondering if this is what we
      needed. So, one day I fired up a Kubernetes Job using <a
        href="https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher/">Tax-Cruncher</a>, and the Job quickly came on-line and ran
      successfully.</p>
    <p>After this mini-experiment, I wrote a Python <code>Job</code> class to wrap interactions with Kuberenetes
      configuration and began integrating this into the compute cluster. The early version of this class required the
      model's owner and title, which Docker image tag to use to run the job, and the simulation inputs:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">from cs_publish.client.job import Job

job = Job(
    project=&quot;cs-workers-dev&quot;,
    owner=&quot;PSLmodels&quot;,
    title=&quot;Tax-Cruncher&quot;,
    tag=&quot;test-job&quot;,
    job_kwargs={
        &quot;adjustment&quot;: {&quot;Policy&quot;: {}, &quot;Tax Information&quot;: {}},
        &quot;meta_param_dict&quot;: {&quot;year&quot;: 2020},
    },
    quiet=False,
)

job.create()
        </code></pre>

    <p>Some advantages that we got for <strong>free</strong> just by swapping from Celery to Kubernetes Jobs are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-default Tags:</strong> Specify the docker image tag that you want to use to run the job. This has
        several cool implications. One day, users could select archived images to run their simulation or modelers could
        publish experimental or non-default images that users can select for their simulations.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero-to-N scaling:</strong> Models are only using compute resources when a simulation is running.
        Compute Studio charges users based on the compute that they use, and this finally brings our compute costs
        in-line with how much users are charged for compute.</li>
      <li><strong>Within Node Parallelization:</strong> Celery <a
          href="https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/1709">doesn't let you start multiple processes</a>. Kubernetes
        pods let you run as many processes as you want subject to the pod's resource limits. This is very helpful for
        models like OG-USA that use Dask to parallelize many of its subroutines. Just swapping to Kubernetes Jobs cut <a
          href="https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/OG-USA/">OG-USA</a> job times from 6 hours to 3 hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The one headache was that the pods created by Kuberenetes Jobs are not cleaned up automatically. There is an
      alpha-level feature called <a
        href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#ttl-mechanism-for-finished-jobs"><code>ttlSecondsAfterFinished</code></a>
      but most cloud providers will not let you use alpha-level features in a managed Kubernetes cluster. To work around
      this, I set up a Kubernetes CronJob to clean up any pods that completed successfully:</p>
    <pre><code class="yaml">apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: job-cleanup
spec:
  schedule: &quot;*/30 * * * *&quot;
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 0
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: job-cleanup
          containers:
            - name: kubectl-container
              image: bitnami/kubectl:latest
              command: [&quot;sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;kubectl delete jobs --field-selector status.successful=1&quot;]
          restartPolicy: Never
        </code></pre>

    <p>The new approach of using Kubernetes Jobs has been in production for about two weeks now and has been running
      smoothly. Our costs have been reduced by about 50%, and we can add as many models as we want without incurring any
      additional financial costs. I'm excited to see how this solution performs as Compute Studio scales up with more
      models and more users.</p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements</h3>
    <p>Since this release turned into a full-scale re-write of the compute cluster, I tried to fix some of the problems
      that were neglected in the first implementation: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>A new CLI:</strong> I created a fancy CLI tool, <code>csw</code>, that has multiple sub and sub-sub
        commands using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html"><code>argparse</code></a>, the CLI
        module in Python's standard library. This vastly improved the ergonomics of working with the compute cluster.
        Prior to <code>csw</code>, I used a half-baked CLI tool that was wrapped with <code>Makefile</code> commands to
        update and deploy the C/S cluster. Now, I can update the C/S services with just a few commands--no
        <code>Makefile</code> needed:</li>
    <pre><code>$ export TAG=new-release
$ csw svc build
$ csw svc push
$ csw svc config -o - | kubectl apply -f -
        </code></pre>

      <li><strong>Improved Secrets Management:</strong> C/S secrets are now stored in a secrets manager and the process
        of accessing and updating them is automated. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/compute-tooling/compute-studio/blob/master/workers/cs_workers/secrets.py"><code>Secrets</code></a> class that wraps the Google Secret
        Manager Python API, and added a <code>secrets</code> subcommand to <code>csw</code> for managing cluster and
        model-level secrets. Soon I'd like to add support for other secrets backends like <a
          href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a>:</li>
    <pre><code># Cluster level secrets
$ csw svc secrets set --secret-name mysecret --secret-value helloworld

# Model level secrets
$ csw models -n PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher secrets set --secret-name super --secret-value secret
$ csw models -n PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher secrets get super
secret
$ csw models -n PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher secrets list
{
  &quot;super&quot;: &quot;secret&quot;
}
$ csw models -n PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher secrets delete super
        </code></pre>

      <li><strong>Simplified configuration:</strong> All model configuration is now in the main C/S database. Now, when
        a model is updated on C/S, the code repository, repository tag, and resource requirements are all pulled from
        the C/S Rest API endpoint <code>https://compute.studio/publish/api/</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Async webservers:</strong> Tornado webservers replaced the Flask and Celery workers. Once the
        simulations were no longer using Celery, it seemed like too much overhead to justify for short-running jobs.
        Further, many of the tasks done by the scheduler service are IO-bound making it an ideal place to use an
        asynchronous approach. I anticipate having to implement some kind of queuing mechanism for some of the services
        like the one for screenshotting outputs and uploading the outputs to cloud storage, but the initial
        implementation is holding up quite well.</li>
      <li><strong>Redis ACL Users:</strong> Now that Celery is no longer used, I have more control over our Redis
        database and can be more careful about which services have access to which data and what they can do with it. I
        used Redis's new <a href="https://redis.io/topics/acl">ACL features</a> that let you define which commands each
        Redis user can use and which keys they can access. The scheduler can get and set keys that start with
        <code>job</code> or <code>projects</code>. The models can only get keys that start with <code>job</code> like
        <code>job-super-long-id</code>. Since each job is given an ID created as a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally Unique Identifier</a>, the job
        can effectively only access data that is specific to it. Once the job is complete, it sends the results to an
        outputs processor service that uploads the results to cloud storage and to the C/S webapp.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
    <p>As exciting as this release is for the C/S team, I'm more excited for the features that we will be able to add
      next. I'm thinking about completely automated publishing and deploys, enabling model maintainers to manage their own
      secrets from the GUI, enabling users to select which version of a model they want to use, adding different types
      of model deployments like interactive servers made with Dash, and the list goes on.</p>
