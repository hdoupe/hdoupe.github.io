    <h2>Features overview:</h2>
    <p>Compute Studio 1.0 transforms simulations into documents that you can title, annotate, and share. Simulation
      creators now have the ability to provide the necessary context to their simulations that is needed to make
      them shareable products. Like documents, simulation configurations can change over time and be modified by
      multiple authors, and the new history feature will make it easy to look back and see what has changed and
      who made those changes. Finally, simulations can be made public or private, giving their creators the power
      to choose when they are ready to share their simulation with the public. During this process, we streamlined
      the sign in and sign up flow by further integrating it into the simulation page, and we slimmed down our
      outputs page. Those of us working on the Compute Studio project are beyond excited to add these features and
      to continue to build on top of them. </p>
    <p>If you have any questions or feedback about this release or C/S in general, please don't hesitate to send me
      an <a href="mailto:hank@compute.studio">email</a> or <a
        href="https://github.com/compute-tooling/compute-studio/issues/new">open an issue</a> in the C/S code
      repository.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Matt Jensen for designing the new simulation page. Also, thanks to Peter Metz for giving feedback
      on this set of features at every step along the way, including the morning after they were shipped. Finally,
      thanks to the C/S publishers for updating their models to the new outputs API.</p>

    <h2>Engineering process:</h2>
    <p>In order to build the simulation document, we needed to transform our server-rendered frontend into a cutting
      edge client-side application that could quickly respond to users and manage user and simulation state. The
      first problem was that the C/S inputs and outputs pages are really heavy, with the Tax-Brain inputs page
      rendering over 400 input fields and the outputs page rendering dozens of detailed HTML tables and several
      interactive plots. Last July, I re-wrote the inputs form in JavaScript, using the <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/">React UI</a> framework and the <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/">Formik</a>
      form library. This resulted in an inputs page that
      loaded quickly, responded immediately to input, and easily handled asynchronous validation with the models
      in the compute cluster. This new inputs page went live in <a
        href="https://hankdoupe.com/posts/COMP-0.12.0.html">C/S 0.12.0</a>.</p>
    <p>Next up, we combined the outputs and inputs pages, and in the process, we made the outputs render just as
      quickly as the inputs page by pre-rendering the results, taking screen-shots of them, and rendering those
      screen-shots instantly while the outputs loaded asynchronously. The results are rendered in a headless
      chromium browser using <a href="https://github.com/miyakogi/pyppeteer">Pyppeteer</a>, a Python port of <a
        href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>, to render each result and take a screen
      shot of the HTML node that the result is encompassed in. This approach was simple and worked surprisingly
      well, delivering tight screen-shots without much unused white space surrounding them. The hardest part of
      this step was that all of the existing interactive Bokeh plots on Compute Studio were in the wrong format.
      We'd stored them in an HTML format that was incompatible with the JSON format required by Bokeh's JavaScript
      API. However, <a href="https://discourse.bokeh.org/t/migrating-from-components-to-json-items/4104/4">thanks
        in large part to Bryan on the Bokeh team</a>, I developed a series of regular expressions to convert our
      existing HTML data into the JSON format that we needed, and it <em>somehow</em> worked flawlessly:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python" lang="python">
# don't try this at home
exp = r'{"roots":.+"version":"[0-9].[0-9].[0-9]"}'
res = re.search(exp, output["data"]["javascript"])
unescaped = (
    res.group(0)
    .replace("&gt;", "&gt;")
    .replace("&lt;", "&lt;")
    .replace("&amp;gt;", "&gt;")
    .replace("&amp;lt;", "&lt;")
    .replace("\\n", "\n")
    .replace('\\"', '\"')
)
parsed = json.loads(unescaped)
root_id = parsed["roots"]["root_ids"][0]
output["data"] = {"target_id": None, "root_id": root_id, "doc": parsed}
    </code></pre>
    <p>The final step was to turn our <em>single page simulation</em> into a <em>simulation document</em> by adding
      a title and an editor to write the description. We chose the <a href="https://docs.slatejs.org/">Slate
        editor framework</a> so that we could have the ability to customize our editor to our needs such as
      potentially linking the editor to comments on parameter sections. I adapted the <a
        href="https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext">Rich Text</a> and <a
        href="https://www.slatejs.org/examples/links">Link</a> examples in their documentation to our needs, and
      now we have an easy-to-use editor. I initially looked into using a Markdown editor with a preview button but
      this wasn't a good fit for our use case since our users aren't likely to be familiar with Markdown and would
      be more familiar with a WYSIWYG experience from their editor.</p>
    <p>This release streamlines Compute Studio's authentication so that users can sign up at any point in the
      process of viewing or creating a simulation without losing any of their data on the page. <a
        href="https://hankdoupe.com/posts/Compute-Studio-0.13.0-0.14.0.html">C/S 0.14.0</a> added a
      sign-in/sign-up window to the run simulation dialog; however, we needed a solution for users who would want
      to write a title or some notes for their simulation before they clicked "Run". The solution was to use <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html">React Portal</a> to hook onto the existing "Sign in" /
      "Sign up" buttons and replace them with their React twins allowing the user to sign in or sign up through a
      dialog window. On completion, the application state is updated and either a new simulation object is created
      for them in the C/S database or they get write access to the simulation they are viewing if they are owners
      of it or the ability to "fork" it if they are not.</p>
    <p>Compute Studio 1.0 is such a massive release that all of the new features can't be covered in a single blog
      post. I could go on for thousands and thousands of words about converting Compute Studio to TypeScript, a
      statically typed superset of JavaScript, which has vastly improved the frontend developer experience for
      Compute Studio and made it easy and fast to refactor the code for this release several times.</p>
