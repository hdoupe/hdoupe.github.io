            valuable tools for exploring data using Bokeh or Dash. It makes me
            incredibly excited that C/S can now host apps created with them.
            This is also a way for C/S to meet develepers where they are by
            supporting the tools that they already use every day. In turn, C/S
            offers them the capability to share their work with colleagues,
            friends, or the public at large.</span

            developer, app sponsor, or app user must pay for the compute costs.
            One of the requirements when building this out was to make sure that
            the apps are only running when they are being used. This resulted in
            a low-cost way for developers to deploy and share their Bokeh and
            Dash/Plotly creations.

                Every 15 minutes a process runs that asks this for every live
                deployment. If there hasn’t been a full page load or ping in
                over 30 minutes, the deployment is spun down. The frontend does
                this by doing a </span

            >Now that some of the Kubernetes resources are controlled by a REST
            API endpoint, I needed to make sure that not just anyone can
            manipulate the compute cluster. After some research, it seemed like
            there are two approaches that could be used to authenticate requests
            to the compute cluster. One is </span

            ><span>OAuth 2.0</span></a

            great deal of complexity to the architecture of C/S since it
            required an external authentication service. In the end, the
            simplest way forward was to use a JWT approach where the frontend
            and compute cluster use a securely stored secret to encode and
            decode JWT’s. Then, when the cluster receives requests, it ensures
            that it can decode the JWT token in the request header with the
            shared JWT secret.</span

            learn a different part of the Kubernetes API. By the end of each

            and general infrastructure knowledge as I had at the beginning. It’s

              countless errors and bugging my friend who does this stuff
              full-time. Finally, I swapped over to Traefik, and within a couple
              hours, I had it working. Further, the routing support wound up
              being extremely useful for routing requests to the right viz
