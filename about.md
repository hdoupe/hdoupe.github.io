I'm a Research Associate at the [Open Source Policy Center][1] and a cofounder of [Compute Tooling][2]. Growing up, I wanted to be an economist, but I also had an unexplained attraction to Wired magazine. In college, I discovered that attraction stemmed from a latent desire to be a software developer. I've oscillated between these two career paths ever since. These days, I'm on a long swing towards becoming a software developer. 

I've created this site to give myself a place to write about software, bikes, and books.
